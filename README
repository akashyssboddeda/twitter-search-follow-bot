The twitter search follow bot:
 * Searches twitter public timeline for configurable keywords
 * Can restrict those users to a particular location too, and,
 * Follows users who tweet with those keywords

Changes in this version:
 * Use search rather than public timeline fetch directly.
 * Much more effective, finds a lot more users!
 * New configuration
 * Now only need to run every 30 minutes rather than every other minute!

Dependencies:
sudo gem install jnunemaker-twitter --source=http://gems.github.com

Configure:

config.yml should be self explanatory.

You can monitor specific keywords from users within a particular lat/long radius. 

Install: 
It's meant to be run as a cron and is not a daemon. Run every thirty minutes or so.

To run:
 ruby -rubygems search-follow-bot.rb
